/*
a linear search or sequential search is a method for finding an element within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.
linear search:-

(i) Start from the leftmost element of arr[] and one by one compare x with each element of arr[]
(ii) If x matches with an element, return the index.
(iii) If x doesnâ€™t match with any of elements, return -1.

Time Complexity: O(N)

Sample I/O:
INPUT:
Enter number of elements in the array: 10
Element the element of the array: 3 323 232 434 32 23 233 26575 545 890
Enter the element which is to find: 233

OUTPUT:
Enter the element which is to find: 233
---------- By Iterative Way ------------------------
Element found at 7 Position.
---------- By Recursive Way ------------------------
Element found at 7 Position.
